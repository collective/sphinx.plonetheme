About
=====

This is a theme for Sphinx that provides a nice plone.org like HTML output.

Requirements
============

You need `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ and all its
requirements. So, follow instructions from this site to install sphinx your own
way.

Of course, you'e supposed to know how to play with Sphinx. Otherwise learn from
the `Sphinx documentation <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html>`_ and come
back here later.

The first version of ``sphinx.plonetheme`` has been developed with Sphinx
0.6.5. It's not tested with earlier versions. Please read HISTORY.txt for
support of later versions of Sphinx.

Installation
============

Create a new Sphinx or go to an existing Sphinx, then, ``cd`` to the directory
that contains your Sphinx's ``conf.py`` (so called "configuration directory" in
Sphinx documentation)

Export with SVN the appropriate version of ``sphinx.plonetheme`` in your own themes directory::

  $ mkdir _themes
  $ cd _themes
  $ svn export \
    http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/sphinx.plonetheme/tags/xxx/plone \
    plone

You may prefer the trunk at your own risks.

Configuring your Sphinx
=======================

Edit your Sphinx's ``conf.py``::

  ...
  html_theme_path = ['_themes']
  ...
  html_theme = 'plone'

Other optional settings in ``conf.py``::

  ...
  # The same favicon as plone.org
  html_favicon = 'favicon.ico'
  ...
  # Opensearch support with Plone icon
  html_use_opensearch = 'http://my.site.tld/mydoc'
  ...
  # Have a disqus setting for this site to have visitors feedback?
  # (register at http://disqus.com/)
  html_theme_options = {
      'disqus_name': 'the_disqus_site_shortname'
      }

Tested with...

Contributing
============

Point your subversion client to
https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/sphinx.plonetheme/trunk (yes you're
propably in since you read this file)

The ``demo/`` folder is the Sphinx I use to test this theme. You may add
more Sphinx constructs to test the Plone Sphinx theme here.

More doc about Sphinx theming can be found from `here
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/theming.html>`_.

Not an egg
==========

At the moment because Sphinx does not have ``PasteScript`` like plugin support
for new themes. So making this component an egg is useless (for now).
